# Cycle_Package
Cycle_package is a fun Python package that displays two racing asciiart cycles riding across the terminal.
Itâ€™s perfect for demonstrating how to create simple terminal animations with Python3.

This is a Python package inspired by the same package "sl" with the train asciart. I managed just by changing the
animating cycles instead of train.  

## Features
- a simple but funny ASCII art animation of cycles.
- Two moving cycles with alternating pedal movements.
- Works on most Linux-based systems and compatible with Python3.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python-3.7 or higher** must be installed.
- Ensure `pip` (Python package manager) is installed. If not found, you can install using the virtual environment
  python-venv, if  couldnot find this package, try searching for it, i bet you will find python-virtualenv.
- now you can activate virtual venv to pip install and deactivete it after

### Using the `.whl` File:
1. Download the `.whl` file (`cycle_animation-1.0-py3-none-any.whl`) from the repository or from the shared location.
2. Install the package using `pip`:
   ```bash
 pip install cycle_animation-1.0-py3-none-any.whl


 ### Run on terminal
  - simply type cycle and you will see the asciiart across the terminal.
